# rock-paper-scissors

This was a pretty challenging JavaScript project. While learning JavaScript concepts, I used to think the language was simple and that I could easily apply what I had learned to this first project. However, when I actually started working on it, I quickly realized I had no idea how to write logical and structured code. I realized that I need to structure a "plan/pseudocode" solution. 

I believe that logical thinking and problem-solving skills are essential not only in real life but also when it comes to programming. Knowing how to properly organize and structure logical code in each project is extremely important. Without these skills, I feel like I wonâ€™t be able to write clean and effective code.
